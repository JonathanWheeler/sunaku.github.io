keyboard layout, embarking on a months-long <a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/151qsif">journey of reprogramming my brain</a>,
rewiring decades worth of accumulated muscle memory through deliberate practice.</p>
<img src="engram-keyboard-layout-monkeytype.png" alt="100+ words per minute on Dactyl Manuform keyboard with Arno&#39;s Engram 2.0 layout"><p></p>
<p>I originally typed in QWERTY for 6 years, then <a href="https://www.dvzine.org/zine/">Dvorak</a> for 16 years, and finally
<a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/BEAKL">BEAKL-15</a> for the last 6 months.  This time, a novel layout of <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0287">rigorous scientific
design</a> caught my attention and I eagerly watched it develop into 2.0:</p>

<blockquote>

<div id="arnos-engram-layout" class="section"></div><h1 class="heading">Arno&rsquo;s Engram layout<a href="#arnos-engram-layout" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a><a href="#__arnos-engram-layout__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a></h1>
<p><a href="https://engram.dev/">Arno&rsquo;s Engram layout</a> v2.0 is an optimized key layout for touch typing in
English based on ergonomic considerations, with a protocol and software
for creating new, optimized key layouts in other languages.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In particular, placing <em>punctuation in the middle columns</em> of the keyboard
eliminates lateral movement of the index fingers while simultaneously providing
quick access to frequently used punctuation marks (i.e. comma and period feel
heavenly). I haven&rsquo;t seen any other layouts do this before; especially spilling
over the remaining letters to the right hand pinky cluster &mdash; it&rsquo;s pure genius!</p>
<p>The layout is very comfortable and it also lends itself well to programming.
Notably, I&rsquo;m a die-hard Vim user and it passes my test for ergonomic Vim usage:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>J</code> and <code>K</code> are adjacent (identical to <a href="https://www.dvzine.org/zine/">Dvorak</a>, actually) &mdash; ideal üíØ</li>
<li><code>H</code> and <code>L</code> are adjacent (albeit on the same finger) &mdash; good üëç</li>
<li><code>W</code> is on right-hand strong ring finger &mdash; good üëç</li>
<li><code>B</code> is on left-hand weak pinky finger &mdash; ouch ü§ï (but the left-hand strong
ring finger can easily hop over to take the load off the pinky &mdash; okay üëç)</li>
<li>Punctuation is in the middle so either hand can type it &mdash; ideal üíØ</li>
<li>Shifted symbols on number keys are intuitive or mnemonic &mdash; great üëç</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/binarybottle">Arno Klein</a> for
sharing his genius with the world. üôá  This layout is truly a masterpiece;
a game changer! ü§© Moreover, its systematic and methodical invention (and
generous explanation thereof) allows interested people <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202103.0287">to understand <em>how</em></a>
this layout has come to be (by simply rendering the Python notebook on
their own system) and to perform further research and improvement.</p>

<p>It has been a week since I switched to Engram and here is my experience so far:</p>
<a href="https://www.keybr.com/profile/151qsif"><img src="engram-keyboard-layout-week1.png" alt="My progress in Typing Speed, Number of Errors, and Number of Keys."></a><p>Curiously, the <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/BEAKL">BEAKL-15</a> layout that I switched over from has <em>the same
left-hand vowel cluster</em> as Engram, and this commonality significantly reduced
my transition time.  In contrast, it took me a month to become comfortable with
that vowel cluster when I previously switched from <a href="https://www.dvzine.org/zine/">Dvorak</a> to BEAKL-15 six
months ago.</p>

<p>After another week of real-world use (but this time without as much
dedicated typing practice), I&rsquo;m happy to say that I&rsquo;m now comfortably
typing at ~60 WPM as the new Engram muscle memory is finally taking
precedence in my brain (thank goodness for neuroplasticity!). ü§ì</p>
<p>I made a few tweaks to the ortholinear version of Engram on <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/dam5g/latest/0">my Ergodox
EZ keymap</a>
for programming convenience and general comfort:</p>

<ul>
<li>I relocated the <code>@ # /</code> keys to the unused left-hand pinky keys (the
slash is especially handy for URLs, file paths, and Vim searching)</li>
<li>I put redundant square &amp; angle brackets on either single-hand
(otherwise the ortholinear split disconnects them, very far apart)</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/dam5g/latest/4">a dedicated symbol layer</a>
that further minimizes reaching by clustering frequent sigils &amp;
delimiters along the home row/block.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I would like to emphasize that Engram feels very
comfortable to type in.  With BEAKL-15, I often felt like I&rsquo;m &ldquo;climbing
a wall&rdquo; when typing (for example, the word &ldquo;spring&rdquo; has me reaching up
and down a lot).  Whereas with Engram, I feel like I&rsquo;m &ldquo;spreading my
wings&rdquo; and gracefully taking flight.  It&rsquo;s a significant qualitative
improvement. üòå</p>

<div id="one-month-later" class="section"></div><h2 class="heading">One month later<a href="#one-month-later" class="permalink" title="Permalink"></a><a href="#__one-month-later__" class="uplink" title="Contents"></a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a month since I&rsquo;ve switched to Engram 2.0 and I&rsquo;m happy to report
that I&rsquo;m comfortably typing at 70+ WPM. ü§©</p>
<p>In particular, I&rsquo;ve noticed that my inter-key typing speed is the fastest I&rsquo;ve
ever observed in my 23 years of typing! üèÉüí® Portions of words (especially
those in rolls) form rapidly on my screen as I type, though entire words take
relatively longer due to momentary pauses as my muscle memory context switches
between different finger/hand placements. This is no doubt the result of those
interkey speed and finger strength matrices applied from Arno Klein&rsquo;s extensive
research. üëå</p>
<p>Overall, I feel that I&rsquo;m now at 95% confidence while typing: subconsciously
finding the right keys to press and positioning my fingers in anticipation of
the next characters coming down the pipeline.  Productivity wise, I feel 50%
<em>more</em> efficient.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this newfound speed &amp; efficiency was achieved while maintaining
typing comfort, not at its expense.  For example, the word &ldquo;highlight&rdquo; is
delightful to type in Engram whereas I had to mentally prepare myself and
concentrate to type it quickly in BEAKL-15.</p>
<p>However, I do notice minor slowdowns on upward-traveling same-finger bigrams
such as &ldquo;je&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;object&rdquo;, but this is more influenced by the style of
keyboard being used than Engram itself.  For instance, I notice this more on my
Ergodox, which has larger &amp; distantly placed keys than those on my laptop.  In
general, Engram scores well with low <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/ncewbo/arnos_engram_keyboard_layout/gz3oflk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">1.24% Same Finger Bigrams (SFBs)</a>. üëå</p>
<p>In conclusion, Engram feels very comfortable due to its generous allotment of
inward rolls (that &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;th&rdquo; feel amazing), heavier emphasis on home row
and bottom rows, balanced distribution between vertical climbs &amp; horizontal
spreads. üíØ</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve reached a comfortable speed of 100+ WPM with Engram 2.0 after properly
configuring my programmable keyboard with <a href="home-row-mods.html">custom firmware that disambiguates
<em>home row mods</em></a> and lets me type more naturally, without artificial slowdowns. ü•≤</p>
<img src="engram-keyboard-layout-monkeytype.png" alt="100+ words per minute on Dactyl Manuform keyboard with Arno&#39;s Engram 2.0 layout"><p>Looking back at my progress, I see that I had <a href="https://github.com/binarybottle/engram/discussions/15#discussioncomment-838277">already reached a speed of 70+ WPM
after a month</a>,
so it was my keyboard&rsquo;s firmware that held me back until now! üöÄ</p>
